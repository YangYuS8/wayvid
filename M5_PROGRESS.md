## 🎯 Sprint 1 (Week 1): Performance

**Goal**: Implement shared decode context and achieve 60% CPU reduction

### Issue #13: Shared Decode Context (18h) ✅ Merged

**Branch**: ~~`m5-shared-decode`~~ (merged)  
**PR**: #17 ✅ **MERGED**  
**Status**: ✅ **Complete and merged to main**  
**Time Spent**: 18h  
**Merged**: 2025-10-23  

**Achievements**:
- ✅ SharedDecodeManager singleton with lifecycle management
- ✅ DecoderHandle with automatic reference counting
- ✅ SourceKey for unique video source identification
- ✅ WaylandSurface integration (replaced MpvPlayer)
- ✅ Performance tested on dual displays (2160x1440 + 2560x1440)

- ✅ Comprehensive documentation (SHARED_DECODE.md, RFC M5-001)
- ✅ Test scripts (test_m5_performance.sh, analyze_test_log.sh)

**Expected Benefits**:
- CPU: 60% reduction (multi-display scenario)
- Memory: 73% reduction (shared decoder + frame buffer)
- Scalability: Support unlimited displays with constant resource usage

**Note**: Per-surface playback controls temporarily disabled, to be redesigned in v0.5.0

### Issue #16: Frame Skip Intelligence (11h) ✅ Complete

**Branch**: ~~`m5-frame-skip`~~ (pending PR)  
**PR**: #20 (to be created)  
**Status**: ✅ **Complete, ready for PR**  
**Time Spent**: 8h  
**Completed**: 2025-10-24  

**Achievements**:

## 📈 Performance Targets vs Current

| Metric | Baseline (v0.3.0) | Target (v0.4.0) | Current | Progress |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|---------|----------|
| CPU (3 displays) | ~30% | ~12% | ~20% | 33% (#13) |
| Memory (3 displays) | ~380MB | ~100MB | ~340MB* | 14% (#14) |
| Memory (1 display) | ~160MB | ~107MB | ~149MB | 20% (#14) |
| Startup Time | ~800ms | ~480ms | ~800ms | 0% |

*Estimated based on single-display measurements (149MB × 3 ≈ 450MB naive, ~340MB with shared decoder)

## 🔧 Technical Decisions

### 2025-10-23: Shared Decode Context Design

**Decision**: Use singleton pattern with RwLock for SharedDecodeManager

**Rationale**:
- Global state needed for cross-output coordination
- RwLock allows concurrent read access for stats
- Write lock only needed for decoder lifecycle
- OnceLock ensures thread-safe initialization

**Trade-offs**:
- Lock contention on decoder acquire/release (acceptable, infrequent)
- Singleton makes testing slightly harder (mitigated with good test design)

### 2025-10-23: VideoSource Hash Implementation

**Decision**: Manual Hash implementation using f64::to_bits()

**Rationale**:
- f64 doesn't implement Eq/Hash (IEEE 754 NaN semantics)
- FPS is configuration, not computed value
- Using bit representation is safe for our use case
- Allows VideoSource to be HashMap key

**Alternative Considered**: Use ordered float wrapper (rejected: too heavyweight)
