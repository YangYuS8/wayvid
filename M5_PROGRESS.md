## 🎯 Sprint 1 (Week 1): Performance

**Goal**: Implement shared decode context and achieve 60% CPU reduction

### Issue #13: Shared Decode Context (18h) 🚧 In Progress

**Progress**: 10% (2/18 hours)

#### ✅ Completed Tasks
- [x] Design context sharing API
  - Created `SharedDecodeManager` singleton
  - Designed `SourceKey` for unique source identification
  - Implemented `DecoderHandle` with reference counting
- [x] Add reference counting
  - Auto-increment on `acquire_decoder()`
  - Auto-decrement on `DecoderHandle::drop()`
  - Automatic cleanup when ref_count reaches 0
- [x] Write comprehensive tests
  - Test source key equality
  - Test decoder reference counting
  - Test multiple different sources
  - **All 3 tests passing** ✅

**Latest Commit**: `fbaa328` - "feat(m5-p0): Add shared decode context foundation (RFC M5-001)"

#### 🔄 In Progress Tasks
- [ ] Implement SharedDecodeContext
  - [ ] Integrate actual MpvPlayer instance
  - [ ] Replace placeholder frame buffer
  - [ ] Add frame synchronization
  - [ ] Implement frame notification system

#### ⏳ Pending Tasks
- [ ] Implement resource pooling
  - [ ] Add texture pool for frame buffers
  - [ ] Implement buffer recycling
  - [ ] Add memory usage tracking
- [ ] Add synchronization primitives
  - [ ] Implement frame ready notification
  - [ ] Add consumer registration system
  - [ ] Handle multi-threaded access
- [ ] Update docs
  - [ ] Document SharedDecodeManager API
  - [ ] Add usage examples
  - [ ] Update architecture diagrams

#### 📝 Notes
- Foundation is solid with proper separation of concerns
- Reference counting working perfectly in tests
- Need to integrate with actual MPV rendering pipeline
- Frame buffer implementation will use `Arc<[u8]>` for zero-copy

## 🔧 Technical Decisions

### 2025-10-23: Shared Decode Context Design

**Decision**: Use singleton pattern with RwLock for SharedDecodeManager

**Rationale**:
- Global state needed for cross-output coordination
- RwLock allows concurrent read access for stats
- Write lock only needed for decoder lifecycle
- OnceLock ensures thread-safe initialization

**Trade-offs**:
- Lock contention on decoder acquire/release (acceptable, infrequent)
- Singleton makes testing slightly harder (mitigated with good test design)

### 2025-10-23: VideoSource Hash Implementation

**Decision**: Manual Hash implementation using f64::to_bits()

**Rationale**:
- f64 doesn't implement Eq/Hash (IEEE 754 NaN semantics)
- FPS is configuration, not computed value
- Using bit representation is safe for our use case
- Allows VideoSource to be HashMap key

**Alternative Considered**: Use ordered float wrapper (rejected: too heavyweight)
